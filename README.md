# Notes
Public TODO list for dandeliondeathray.

## Dandelion Slack bot
The Dandelion Death Ray Slack bot library will be used for niancat, and presumably other bots
as well.

Things we're working on:

- A Slack API
- A WebSocket client, needed by the Slack API

Things we will work on, eventually:

- A Slack bot library, as a more usable layer built ontop of Slack API
- Niancat

## Ideas
A "KAFKA" bot that keeps info on the next meeting, and reminds people.
